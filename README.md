#Euler_LoctaVoltera
![alt text](img/output.png"Description goes here")

School project, the objective is to find a solution to a math problem in our case: "how to represent the locta voltera equation".

#What is locta voltera

It's an equation reprensenting the evolution of a prey/predator population.

#How does it work 

In this project we are using the Euler method to get a approximation of the function.

#How to use it

This project is not intended to be used but if you still want to then just launch the program with python2, you'll need gnuplut installed, it will produce a graph named output.png, the function variables are hard coded into the program.
